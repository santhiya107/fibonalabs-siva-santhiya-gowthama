                            We at Smile Genius were looking for a professional and reliable company to work with on our
                            idea. We had meetings with quite a few companies in Ireland, UK, Poland, and India. The
                            companies/ individuals were either pure developers with no design experience or only had
                            design experience. We were looking for not a supplier but a partner. I spoke to the
                            Fibonalabs team and was impressed after the first meeting. Our belief in the company
                            strengthened day by day, starting with the in-depth marathon workshops on design. Fibonalabs
                            team is very professional and very strong. We look forward to working with them for our
                            future phases as well.

                            much better understanding of what we were trying to build and what our customers really
                            wanted us to build. The workshop was a great collaborative thinking experience that set the
                            path for the first six months of our brand and business journey.

                            BlackBuck and its sister firm
                            GreyLink. They were involved right from understanding the end-users to mapping core UX
                            needs, prototyping, testing, and final front-end development. Working with them felt like an
                            extension of BlackBuck itself. The team took ownership like an internal team and delivered
                            like an internal team. In 10 months, we launched 6 product systems with them- from scratch
                            to delivery. These products sat in the crucial supply chain management of large
                            manufacturing firms. The intuitiveness of the products, phenomenal speed of delivery, and an
                            intimate partnership were what stood out during the times that we worked together.
